Blazor projecs with DataJuggler.Blazor.Components. The output of this project is an image

     width="455" height="270" alt="Blazor Jeopardy" />

This project creates images like the blue questions on Jeopardy.

What you will need: 

# Visual Studio 2022 
It should run on VS 2026 I just haven't tested it yet

# Regionizer 2022
https://github.com/DataJuggler/Regionizer2022

There is a VSIX package located in Regionizer2022\Regionizer\Install\Regionizer2022.vsix

Even if you hate regions, you will like the new features to wire up DataJuggler.Blazor.Components.
